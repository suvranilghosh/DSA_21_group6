# Shortest Drone Delivery Route Finder
- An application of travelling salesman problem that runs at O(N!) time complexity.
- Input to this implementation is supposed to be a list of coordinates representing delivery locations and origin
- Output (preliminary): Prints the length of the shortest Hamiltonian cycle
- Execution instruction:
- `<cd to property directory>`
- `python droneRoute.py <filename>`
- Example:
- `python droneRoute.py deliveryLocs13.txt`
